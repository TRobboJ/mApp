# mApp
A country guessing game using Leaflet, written with vanilla JS


TODO & current issues
html and css rewrite (currently using Jonathan's CSS template)
add load event to fetch + catch function (atm you can spam click randomise)
fix mApp call within the then() block (should call "this")
multiple countries of the same guess can be called with my _getRandomCountry function
add dark version option of carto's tilemap
remove random country button after first click -> change to "start"?
easy, med, hard option selection
